;In my theory, a load door is simply a PositionCell function referencing to the PlayerSaveGame once the door is
;activated. (By the player.) For an NPC to activate a load door would, as this "door script" seems hard-coded
;strictly to the player, would call an error that would cause a CTD. This script creates an artificial load door, by
;replacing the "Player" function references to the NPC in question. As this is concerning a REAL load door, I cannot
;have the NPC activate it. Rather, the NPC teleports when they are close enough to the door for activation, and
;a certain variable is set, accompanied by a 3D sound to finalize the effect. NPC load doors are possible. The only
;problem is that the NPC disappears rather than shows an animation of entering the door - but it's not much worse
;than in Oblivion, when the NPC just fades.
