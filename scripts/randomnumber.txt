short number

;works out how many thousands there are
set number to random, 10 
set number to ( number * 1000 )

;how many hundrerds
set spare to random, 10
set spare to ( spare * 100 )
set number to ( number + spare )

;and how many tens
set spare to random, 10
set spare to ( spare * 10 )
set number to ( number + spare )

;this has to be random, 11, rather than random, 10 as if it was random 10,
;it would only be 0 - 9999
set spare to random, 11
set number to ( number + spare )

;the variable number now contains a random number between 0 and 10,000 that you can use
