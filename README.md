# Morrowind Scripting for Dummies -- 2021 edition

Some conditions to this work, as stated by Yacoby, the main author of the 9th version:

> * Please keep the forward to the 8th edition intact (from what I recall this was requested by GhanBuriGhan back in the day, can be waived if you get his permission to do so).
> * Please keep GhanBuriGhan as the primary author (I can't remember if he requested this, but still did the majority of the work on this document)
> * Ideally keep the 9th edition forward as well (I'm not that bothered, but you'd need to get sign off from melian if you wanted to remove it)
>
> I'd also be supportive if you wanted to add some form of open licence to allow a more community owned model (as long as you kept the above conditions in any licence unless you get sign off from GhanBuriGhan)
