# Morrowind Scripting for Dummies -- 10th edition

An update to the venerable [Morrowind Scripting for Dummies](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/13969), still the most comprehensive and beloved guide to MWScript. Authored by GhanBuriGhan, Yacoby and melian.

This in-progress version aims to incorporate the [errata and additional tips gathered by the Tamriel Rebuilt team](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/tutorial-morrowind-scripting-dummies), as well as other improvements, while converting the book to LaTeX for future-proofing and to facilitate collaborative editing.

Some conditions to this work, as stated by Yacoby:

> * Please keep the forward to the 8th edition intact (from what I recall this was requested by GhanBuriGhan back in the day, can be waived if you get his permission to do so).
> * Please keep GhanBuriGhan as the primary author (I can't remember if he requested this, but still did the majority of the work on this document)
> * Ideally keep the 9th edition forward as well (I'm not that bothered, but you'd need to get sign off from melian if you wanted to remove it)
>
> I'd also be supportive if you wanted to add some form of open licence to allow a more community owned model (as long as you kept the above conditions in any licence unless you get sign off from GhanBuriGhan)
